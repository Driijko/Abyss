GAMEPLAY

Abyss is a shoot-em-up (SHMUP) game in the tradition of classic arcade games of the 1970s and 1980s, such as
Space Invaders or Galaxian.
The player can control a vessel via the 'w', 'a', 's' and 'd' keys. You can attack over a short range to the right
by pressing the space bar.
Enemies appear on the right side of the screen and move towards the left side. If they reach the left side, 
or collide with the player's vessel, they trigger an explosion which ends the game.
The player can attack enemies to stop this from happening.
Unlike most classic arcade games, the goal here is simply to survive for as long as possible. A clock
in the bottom left corner indicates how long a player has survived.
Enemies move either straight towards the left, or move along sine wave trajectories.
